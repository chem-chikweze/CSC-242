 Good Progress:::   
    minimax runs and works well. I just need to clean the termination clause for the while loop. 
    I want to make it check if game is in a winnning state. 
    This way the loop terminates on two conditions: 
        1. When the game is in a terminal state and 
        2. When the game is in a winning state
